I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Computer Science at The University of Manchester. I am also a member of The Centre for A.I. Fundamentals. I am deeply intrigued about how deep-learning and neural nets seem to land us at hitherto unforeseen crossroads of geometry and functional analysis. I aspire to unravel these emerging questions in mathematics.
